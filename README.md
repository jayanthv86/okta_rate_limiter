# okta_rate_limiter

The usage is:

python pool.py

It will ask you for 2 arguments: 

1) Enter your Okta URL: companyName.okta.com (without https://www.)
2) Enter your Okta API key (from the same tenant as above)

To get your Okta API key, login to your Okta tenant as a super admin and navigate to Security -> API from the Admin console. If you are using the developer console, this would be under API -> Tokens. Create the token and copy it in a secure place. This value will not be displayed again.
